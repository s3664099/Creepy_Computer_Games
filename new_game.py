This game can be found on page 12 of Computer Space Games, and it a python3 translation.

The goal of this game is for the player to escape from the planet. The player knows the gravity of the planet
but not the weight of the ship. The player needs to guess the force to be applied to launch the ship. If the
force is too high or too low, the ship won't budge, but the player will be informed if it is too high or too
low.

The player gets 10 shots to escape from the planet.
