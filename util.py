Title: Util.py

This file holds functions that are likely to be used across multiple
programs. The clear screen fuction operates under unix-like operating systems.

TimeoutExpired, alarm_handler, and input_with_timeout are fuctions that are
designed to limit the amount of time the user has to input a response. Unfortunately
the user will need to press enter to record the response.

The following package is required:
https://pypi.org/project/inputimeout/

Update 7/2/2021
Added a second input function that doesn't display 'too late'

Update 22/10/2022
Added a few more since, including a start game function that pretty much does what
all the games do at the beginning.
Added another input with timeout function to return true or false

Update 19/11/2022
Added an inkey function
