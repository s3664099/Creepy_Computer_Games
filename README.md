# Creepy Computer Games

These files are a translation of an old programming book from the 1980s
called 'Creepy Computer Games'. The idea was to teach children programming
using basic. Due to multiple different systems back in the day there were marks
advising of when the code needed to be changed for a specific machine.

I used a Commodore 64 for my machine.

However, I have decided to translate them into modern computer languages. Initially
I was going to do it using C++, Java, and Python however issues arose that made me
decide to just use python, due to things that don't exist in modern langauges and would
require threading to be able to execute properly (though not necessarily in the same way
as it was executed on the older computers)

[The book is now available online to download for free](https://ia801902.us.archive.org/3/items/Creepy_Computer_Games_1983_Usborne_Publishing/Creepy_Computer_Games_1983_Usborne_Publishing.pdf)

## Executing the Games

A *shebang* has been included in the files so that they can be executed directly from the
command line. However, for that to work you will need to make the file executable. Since these
games run only on Linux, you will need to go to the directory on the command line and type

*chmod +x [game name].py*

However, a loader program has been included, so that is the only one that theoretically needs to be
executed as all of the other programs can be executed from that one.

## Issues
The issue regarding getting the INKEY to work properly is still present.

## Games

**Computer Nightmare**
This game simply involves copying a character that is displayed on the screen. You have three seconds
to press the correct key. Case is ignored where letters are concerned. If you are correct the score
increases, but if you are incorrect, or take to long, your score goes down. The game ends when you either
get more than 500 or less than 0.

**Number Wizard**
This game involves you matching the numbers that the wizard generates. You have numbers 1 to 9 available
but can only be used once, with the exception of 0, which can be used as many times as you like. The total of
the numbers you select must match the total of the numbers the wizard rolled. If you use all of you numbers you
win, but if you run out of turns, you lose. Oh, and if the wizard rolls a double, you get an extra turn.

**Ghost Guzzler**
This is sort of an arcade game where you have to match the number (that is the ghost). I have removed hard
coded numbers to make it easier to change the difficulty. The problem with the INKEY is also present, as you
need to press 'enter' after typing your action, otherwise nothing will happen. You can only increase the
number (though code to make it decrease isn't all that hard, and will probably make the game easier)

**Spiderwoman**
Another guessing game where you have to guess a letter by throwing out some words. Mind you, there is no
restriction on the words that are entered, which means you can enter any old rubbish. I could reference an
English word list, but I really can't be bothered. Further details of the game are actually in the game itself
so I won't repeat myself here. However, I have fixed some of the hardcoding that was present in the original
(and there are also issue with how answers weren't validated properly, but that is why I have a utils file).

Oh, the list of English words can be found here (https://pypi.org/project/english-words/).

**Gravedigger**
I decided to do something slightly different here and that is to add a graphical option. I actually added a 
query as to whether to play the graphical or the character version of the game, though as it turns out, if you
don't have pygame installed then this game will basically crash (there is a way, according to ChatGPT, that you
can ignore it, but I'm not going to bother - so, you need to have pygame installed).
Anyway, this is a game where you have to escape from a graveyard. You can dig up to five holes. You also need
to avoid the skeletons. I have added code so that if you are next to a skeleton, the skeleton will 'attack'.
One issue is that there is the positioning of the gravestones is completely random, so it is possible, or shall
I say likely, that the exit can be blocked.

**Mad House**
This is another one of those interesting games. You have three doors which you have to line up to be able to
escape. The catch is that you can only control the first and third door by setting the direction that they move.
The second door will move randomly every twenty-five turns. You also have a time limit, namely steps that count
down every turn.

**Ghost Maze**
So, this is a maze that you have to escape from. The thing with this one is that the original game, using
character graphics, was designed so that you would only see what the character could see. As such, while
it opened itself to graphics, it was not the same as the gravedigger, so I decided to do it as a 3D maze - the
only way I could see the graphical aspect working.
Yeah, it was pretty tricky, however I decided not to go full on since I decided to just make the ghost blocks 
yellow and the exit blocks red. Oh, I also added a random maze generator, though I got ChatGPT to do it.

Oh, I should mention that you can either use a random maze, or the set maze, by setting random_builder to
either true or false.

**Sceance**
This is the last game in the book. Basically you have a board where letters are placed around the sides. The game
then randomly selects letters, and you have to repeat them at the end. However, you have to remember the letters,
and you only get three shots.

I have added difficulty levels, which means the words are longer, and the time that you get to see the board is less.
You also need to get a higher score to win, though the three tries (which resets each round) remain the same.
I have also added words and phrases (though with no spaces). There are only about six words per difficulty level (though)
the words for the lesser difficulty levels are available for the greater difficulty levels. You can add words by adding
(or removing) words from the phrases list.

A final idea is that you could have a random phrase being spelt out word for word, but this will require a complete rewrite
so I will leave it at that.

## Updates
**22 July 2023**
Created the initial folder to hold the contents on the game.
Added Computer Nightmare

**30 July 2023**
Added the Number Wizard Game

**20 August 2023**
Added gravedigger game. Made the game graphical as well.

**23 September 2023**
Added Mad House game

**1 October 2023**
Added Ghost Maze Game. Completed basic code. Testing for errors and preparing for graphics.

**16 November 2023**
Completed Ghost Maze. Basically added a graphic interface that is a 3D maze game. The exit square is red
and the ghost square is yellow. I decided that I did not want to do anything more complicated considering
creating a 3D maze game was something tricky in itself.
